    <p class="term-text  margin0">ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS AND POLICIES
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      1. We welcome you to TechCrunch+ (the “Service”), offered by the applicable Verizon Media corporate entity identified in Section 7 below (“TechCrunch”), a service by which Registered users can pay to access premium features of the TechCrunch service.
      TechCrunch+ IS OFFERED ONLY IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      2. Acceptance of the conditions. By using the Service, you and TechCrunch agree to the following terms and policies (and any succeeding URLs): these Additional Paid Terms of Service for TechCrunch+ (“Additional Payment Terms”) (https://verizonmedia.com/policies/xw /en/extracrunch/index.html), which are in addition to the Verizon Media Terms of Service (https://verizonmedia.com/policies/xw/en/verizonmedia/terms/otos/index.html) (collectively, the “Terms”) and the Verizon Media Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) (https://verizonmedia.com/policies/xw/en/verizonmedia/privacy/intl/index.html), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      3. Changes in conditions. TechCrunch reserves the right to update and modify these Additional Payment Terms of Service and all documents incorporated by reference from time to time. You will find the most recent version of the Terms at the URLs included above. You should check these documents periodically for updates. Your continued use of the Service will constitute acceptance of all modified terms. In the event of any inconsistency between these Additional Payment Terms and the Verizon Media Terms of Service, these Additional Payment Terms will prevail.
      YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TERMS AND ALL DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE; READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY.
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">4. CONDITIONS FOR TechCrunch+</p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      1. In order to register for the Service, you must have a TechCrunch account. You must also provide your credit card number, billing information and other information ("Registration Information"), which will be stored for the purpose of processing payments for your subscription and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You agree that the Registration Information you provide is true, valid, accurate, current and complete, and that you will keep such information updated to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, currency and completeness. If you provide information that is not true, accurate, current or complete, or TechCrunch has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is not true, TechCrunch reserves the right to terminate your account and deny you any current or future access to the Service or the use of this.
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      2. You, and not TechCrunch, are responsible for all purchases made through your TechCrunch account or in connection with your TechCrunch ID. TechCrunch is not responsible for unauthorized purchases or errors made using your TechCrunch ID or TechCrunch account. Any disputes regarding purchases must be resolved with the applicable company, online payment service provider, merchant or your bank, to whom you must immediately notify any unauthorized use of your credit card. Your liability in connection with unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your contract with the card issuer or by applicable law. In addition to uses of account information authorized by the Additional Payment Terms or incorporated documents, TechCrunch may access, maintain, control and disclose your card information, believing, in good faith, that such action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, identify or resolve problems, or respond to questions about your Service, but nothing in this section imposes any obligation on TechCrunch to make such disclosures.
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">
      5. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL, REFUNDS AND PAYMENT TERMS
      You can purchase TechCrunch+ with an annual or monthly subscription.
    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">1. Automatic renewal. The current fee for the Service will be automatically and immediately charged to the designated payment method or, if this fails, to any other payment method you have on file with us. You'll find fee details on your account page. The Service is provided on an automatic renewal basis, beginning on the date you register for the Service, until you cancel. The renewal amount will be charged to the designated payment method or, if this fails, to any other payment method you have on file with us, unless you cancel the Service at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. You have the right to cancel the Service at any time. To cancel the Service, log in to techcrunch.com and go to your account page to manage your subscription and cancel the Service.

    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">2. Cancellation of TechCrunch+ automatic renewal. If you decide to cancel the automatic renewal of TechCrunch+h, the cancellation will cease the periodic automatic renewal (annual or monthly) of the Service. You will not receive any refund for the current billing period. You will continue to receive your subscription for the remainder of the current billing period, regardless of your cancellation date. Cancellation will take effect after the end of the current billing period. For example, if the Service is for periods of one month and you cancel on the 5th day of that month, you will continue to receive the Service for the remainder of that month and it will be canceled on the next billing cycle. Also, for example, if the Service is for periods of one year and you cancel on the 100th day of that year, you will continue to receive the Service for the remainder of that year and it will be canceled on the next billing cycle.

    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">3. The amount charged for the Service may change. The amount charged may change. If you do not cancel the Service, you hereby agree that the then current rate for the Service will be charged to the payment method (or, if the designated payment method fails, to any other payment method on file) at the beginning of each renewal period. We will send you a notice whenever a price increase occurs at least thirty (30) days before it becomes effective. Current fee details will be posted at https://techcrunch.com/subscribe. Fees charged for one service cannot be assigned to other services. TechCrunch does not offer price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offer.

    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">4. Discounts and offers. TechCrunch, at its discretion, may from time to time offer discounts or special offers. If you have received a free trial period offer in connection with registering for the Service, you will not be charged for the first time until the free trial period has ended. When the free trial period ends, you will automatically be charged for the Service until you cancel. If you cancel during the trial period, you will no longer have access to the Service after the trial ends, unless you purchase the Service. Subsequent billing dates will correspond to the monthly or annual anniversary of the first billing date. For example, if you purchase an annual subscription on October 15th and get the first 30 days free, and if you don't cancel within the first 30 days, then you won't be charged anything until November 14th (October has 31 days). You will then be automatically charged on November 14 of each subsequent year, until you decide to cancel. If you receive a discount or special offer during the current term, your billing date will be extended by the additional period of the discount or special offer.

    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">5. Users in the EU. If you are a resident of the European Union, this Section 5 will apply without prejudice to your rights described in Sections 14.13(i) and (j) of the Verizon Media Terms of Service.

    </p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">6. TERM AND TERMINATION</p>

    <p class="term-text  margin0">TechCrunch may, but has no liability to do so, immediately terminate the Service and deny any and all current or future access to use the Service if TechCrunch, in its sole discretion, determines that: (a) you have provided information that is not valid, true, accurate, current or complete, or TechCrunch reasonably suspects that such information is not valid, (b) that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, (c) that you engage in activities that could harm the rights of TechCrunch or others, or (d) that you have not complied with the terms of these Additional Paid Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy or the Verizon Media Terms of Service, or any other incorporated terms.
